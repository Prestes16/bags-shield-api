# Fees & Rewards Model

Bags Shield uses a transparent economic model designed to sustain the infrastructure while rewarding active users and partners.

## 1. Protection Fees
Instead of an opaque tax, we charge a small, visible fee on swaps executed through the Shield router. This fee funds:
* Real-time scanning infrastructure.
* Serverless API maintenance.
* Continuous security database updates.

## 2. User Cashback
Users who consistently use the secure route participate in our **Cashback Program**.
* A percentage of the protection fee is returned to the user in the form of protocol points or tokens (future implementation).
* This creates a positive feedback loop: **Security pays back.**

## 3. Partner Fees
Wallets, aggregators, and dApps that integrate the Bags Shield API earn a revenue share.
* **Integrators:** Receive a portion of the fee for every secure swap routed through their UI.
* **Builders:** Incentivized to keep their users safe.
