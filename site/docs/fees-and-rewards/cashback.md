title: Cashback
---

Bags Shield may offer **cashback** on eligible swap volume. This page describes rules, tiers, limits, and anti-abuse measures.

## Eligibility

- Cashback applies only to **swap** transactions executed through the Bags Shield flow (e.g. via our API or Web App).
- The user must complete the transaction on-chain; failed or cancelled transactions do not qualify.
- Eligibility may depend on region, KYC status, or other terms defined at the time of the program.

## Tiers

Cashback is typically structured in tiers based on **volume** or **loyalty**:

| Tier   | Condition        | Cashback rate (example) |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Base   | Default          | e.g. 0.1% of swap fee   |
| Silver | Volume threshold | e.g. 0.2%               |
| Gold   | Higher volume    | e.g. 0.3%               |

Exact percentages and thresholds are set by Bags Shield and may change. Check the app or API for current values.

## Limits

- **Daily / monthly caps** may apply so that no single user exceeds a maximum cashback amount.
- **Minimum payout**: cashback may only be credited or withdrawn once it exceeds a minimum balance.
- **Expiry**: unclaimed cashback may expire after a defined period; see terms for details.

## Anti-abuse checks

To keep the program fair and sustainable, we apply anti-abuse rules:

- **Wash trading**: Self-dealing or circular trades to inflate volume are detected and disqualified.
- **Sybil**: Multiple accounts or wallets used to game tiers may be merged or banned.
- **Velocity**: Unusually high frequency or volume can trigger review; we may withhold or revoke cashback until verified.
- **Fraud**: Any attempt to manipulate the system (e.g. fake volume, identity) results in disqualification and may lead to account suspension.

## How to see your cashback

- In the **Web App**: check the Rewards or Account section for current balance and history.
- Via **API**: if we expose a balance endpoint, it will be documented in the API section.

## Changes to the program

We may update tiers, limits, and anti-abuse rules over time. Continued use of the product after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. For the latest rules, refer to the [Terms of Service](/docs/legal/terms) and in-app notices.
